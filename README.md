# Reach Alpha Blue Heavy Dynamics Simulator

A `ros2_control` simulator for the **BlueROV Heavy** equipped with a **Reach Alpha 5** manipulator. Integrates Thor Fossenâ€™s underwater dynamics with Featherstone's manipulator dynamics algorithm for realistic simulations.

## Features
- **Realistic Dynamics:** Accurate simulation of underwater and manipulator behaviors.
- **Multi-Agent Support:** Simulate multiple agents within a shared environment.
- **Video Demonstration:** [![Watch the Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/VRJUbpdvPIM/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRJUbpdvPIM)

## Getting Started
