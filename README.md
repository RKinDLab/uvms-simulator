# Underwater Vehicle and Manipulator Simulator

A simulator for the **BlueROV Heavy** equipped with a **Reach Alpha 5** manipulator based on the `ros2_control` framework. Integrates Thor Fossenâ€™s underwater dynamics with Featherstone's manipulator dynamics algorithm for realistic simulations.

---

## Features

- **Realistic Dynamics:** Accurate simulation of underwater vehicle and manipulator behaviors.
- **Multi-Agent Support:** Simulate multiple agents within a shared environment.
- **Hardware-in-the-Loop Support:** Integrates BlueROV Heavy hardware including IMU, A50 DVL, and Reach Alpha 5 manipulator for realistic interaction and testing.
- **Video Demonstration:** [![Watch the Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/VRJUbpdvPIM/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRJUbpdvPIM)

## Hardware-in-the-Loop Setup

To enable Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) simulation with the BlueROV Heavy, follow these additional steps:

1. **Connect Hardware Components:**
   - **IMU:** Ensure the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) is properly connected to your system.
   - **A50 DVL:** Connect the Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) to interface with the simulator.
   - **Reach Alpha 5 Manipulator:** Integrate the manipulator hardware following the [Reach Robotics SDK](https://github.com/Reach-Robotics/reach_robotics_sdk/tree/master) guidelines.

2. **Configure ROS2 Nodes:**
   - Launch the appropriate ROS2 nodes to interface with each hardware component.
   - Update the simulation configuration files to include hardware topics and parameters.

3. **Calibrate Sensors:**
   - Perform calibration for the IMU and DVL to ensure accurate data representation within the simulator.

4. **Testing:**
   - Run the simulator and verify that real-time data from the hardware components is accurately reflected in the simulation environment.
   - Use the provided controllers to manipulate the Reach Alpha 5 and observe interactions within the simulated underwater environment.

For detailed instructions on setting up HIL, refer to the [Hardware-in-the-Loop Documentation](doc/hil_setup.rst).
